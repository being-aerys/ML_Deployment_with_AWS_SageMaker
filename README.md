# Machine Learning Deployment in Production with AWS SageMaker
This repo demonstrates how machine learning models can be trained, deployed, and updated in production with AWS SageMaker. It is a work in progress.<br>
This work is a collection of several projects as structured below.
1. Sentiment Analysis
2. Price Prediction
3. Population Segmentation
4. Payment Fraud Detection
5. Time Series Forecasting<br>

Following is an example Web App from one of the projects above. Notice that the outcome is from a poor model.
